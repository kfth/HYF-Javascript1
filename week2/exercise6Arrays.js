//6. Arrays
/*6.1 Declare an empty array. Make sure that the name you choose indicates 'plurality',
 because an array is capable of containing more than one element. (See Naming conventions).*/
let capitalCities=[];

//6.2 Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
console.log("This array will store the names of capital cities")

//6.3 console.log your array.
console.log(capitalCities);

//6.4 Create an array that has your favorite animals inside (see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold).
let myFavoriteAnimals=["cat","horse","tiger"]

//6.5 Log your array.
console.log(myFavoriteAnimals);
console.log(typeof myFavoriteAnimals);

//6.6 Add a statement that adds Daan's favorite animal ('baby pig') to the existing array.
myFavoriteAnimals.push("baby pig");

//6.7 Log your new array!
console.log(myFavoriteAnimals);
