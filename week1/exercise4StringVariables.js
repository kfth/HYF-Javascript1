//Exercise 4

let y="This is the first string";

//4.1 Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is.
console.log("the value of my string will be: This is the first string");

//4.2 Now console.log the variable y.
console.log("Value of string y is: "+ y);

//4.3 Now assign a new string to the variable y.
